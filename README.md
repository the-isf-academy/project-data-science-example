# Data Science project

The final project for this unit will be a small research project. Working with the data science tools we explored this unit, you will ask and answer a question using data we collected about our digital lives. You will present your findings to your peers.

To be successful in this project, you will need to find a question that is both interesting to you and answerable (at least in part) with data from the social media dataset. Your teachers will help you make sure your question achieves that.
